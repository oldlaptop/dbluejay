DBlueJay is a general-purpose database GUI, to TDBC what dbeaver is to JDBC,
but like a blue jay it weighs much less than a beaver. (Hopefully it is less
loud and obnoxious than real blue jays.) All of the core TDBC drivers have at
least some support, and some level of database-specific schema enumeration is
performed for the SQLite3 and PostgreSQL drivers; MySQL also gets a little more
schema enumeration than the TDBC specification provides through the standard
INFORMATION_SCHEMA. DBlueJay is far and away the smallest database-browsing GUI
(let alone the smallest universal one) known to its author, and has the
corresponding level of creature comforts; its main design goal is to allow easy
prototyping of complex queries, with a browsable schema and result-set view that
don't interfere with the query editor (as a CLI database monitor generally does
without extra fiddling).

Installation should be reasonably straightforward with the included Makefile;
try running the default target for more information. Besides Tcl and Tk (8.6+)
themselves, you'll need TDBC and an appropriate selection of TDBC drivers (this
may or may not be a separate package from Tcl itself on free *NIX systems),
tcllib (for Snit), and my libcargocult, the installation procedure for which
is very much like that for DBlueJay (https://github.com/oldlaptop/libcargocult).

Documentation other than the file you're reading may at this time be found
inline in the source code.
