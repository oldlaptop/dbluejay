DBlueJay is a general-purpose database GUI, to TDBC what dbeaver is to JDBC,
but like a blue jay it weighs much less than a beaver. (Hopefully it is less
loud and obnoxious than real blue jays.) In its current form it may be regarded
as an experiment in building a universal database browser from as little code as
possible (currently some 600SLOC, which datum is "generated using David
A. Wheeler's SLOCCount"), but it is likely to grow in the future (though not to
beaver-like proportions).

Documentation other than the file you're reading may at this time be found
inline in the source code.
